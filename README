I seek no approval of what I put on this branch, but
suggestions would be nice.

Folder descriptions:

androidapp: The Android App (mostly backend for now)

server: The Twisted Server

guiclient: Java Swing client. Automatically formats json properly.

autoclient: In case you want to run a few tests over and over.
